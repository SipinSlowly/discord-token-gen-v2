This is an updated version of one of my most popular repository. This was origonally in nodejs, but I have remade it, in python

proxies are not needed, but they will help with Discord's ratelimits, if you do not have proxies I recommend you keep threads at 2-4 every couple of minutes

1. Download Python at (https://www.python.org)
2. Make sure it's connect to your path by looking in Environment Variables 
3. Download the folder
4. Run the setup it should download the requiments
5. Then run start and the program should start running
